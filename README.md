# blender-fbximporter
blender addon for creating havok/hkt scene file with all needed settings for creating physics

Requirements

Blender: Latest version from Steam (tested and recommended).
You may try using older versions down to 2.93.0, but they are unsupported and may cause unknown issues.

Visual Studio 2012 Redistributable (Update 4):
Download from the official Microsoft page:

Guides
So far thereâ€™s only one I made for the addon, and one for the 3ds Max version.
For the 3ds Max one, just skip the setup part and follow the steps from the first video instead.
